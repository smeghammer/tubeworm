idea:
-----
switchable teleport panel with crate taht disappears on activation:

 - blue
 - off initially
 - crate on plat (actually a 3d projection)
 - switch somewhere
 - switch does:
	- turns on light
	- enables teleport lines to secret
	- removes crate
	- can now teleport to secret area.
	
	crate tp need to be secret area
	crane opposite secret needs more monsdters
	arena monsters in void!
	
	back entrance to goodies room needs to release monsters (2x barons?, lock-in trap?)
